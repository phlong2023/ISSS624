# Analysis of Geospatial Distribution of Bus Ridership by Origin Bus Stop in Singapore

## Objectives

The bus system is one of Singapore's two pillars of public transport aside from the MRT. The bus system ensures convenient and affordable short-, medium-, and long-distance travel for riders. Thanks to the widespread availability of bus stops as compared to MRT stations, it has a high level of accessibility. However, this also leaves the system prone to under- or over-investment in terms of the number of bus routes, leading some stops and routes to be under-served or over-served.

The objective of this study is to examine the distribution of bus trips in Singapore by analyzing the number of trips by originating bus stops. It will consist of two levels of analysis:

1.  GeoVisualisation and Analysis: Visualizing the number of trips by originating bus stops and provide descriptive statistics of the distribution of trips by bus stops.
2.  Local Indicators of Spatial Association Analysis (LISA): This analysis involves the calculation of Local Moran's I to determine local spatial autocorrelation between a bus stop and its neighbors. Additionally, visualizations such as a LISA cluster map will be created for easier comparison.

## Getting Started

First, the necessary R packages will be loaded using the *p_load()* function of the **pacman** package. *p_load()* will also install any package which is not already installed. The following packages will be loaded:

-   [**sf**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html)**:** For handling of geospatial data.

-   [**sfdep**](https://sfdep.josiahparry.com/)**:** For determining the spatial dependence of spatial features. The three main categories of functionality relates to the determination of geometry neighbors, weights, and LISA.

-   [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/)**:** For manipulation of non-spatial data. This package contains ggplot2 for plotting, dplyr and tidyr for dataframe manipulation, and readr for reading comma-separated values (CSV).

-   [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html)**:** For thematic mapping, especially the mapping of simple features data frame.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf,sfdep,tidyverse,tmap)
```

## Importing Required Data

For the purpose of this study, two types of data will be used: geospatial data which consists of spatial features and their coordinates information, and aspatial data which consists of attributes which can be ascribed to the geospatial data. Specifically, the following datasets will be used for each type:

1.  Geospatial Data:
    -   BusStop.shp: This shape file contains the location of the bus stops in Singapore as at July 2023. This file can be retrieved from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) Data Mall ([link](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/search_datasets.html?searchText=bus%20stop)).
2.  Aspatial Data:
    -   origin_destination_bus_202309.csv: This CSV file contains the detail of bus trips from an originating bus stop to a destination bus stop, identified by their unique codes, each hour of the day during September 2023. The data is further broken down into weekend or weekday, but not by the specific day of the week. This data can be retrieved by using the LTA Data Mall's API ([link](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/datamall/datasets/LTA_DataMall_API_User_Guide.pdf)).

The first steps taken will be to import these files into the R environment in a manipulable format.

### Importing Geospatial Data

Geospatial data can be imported using the *st_read()* function of the sf package. This will import the file into the R environment as a sf (simple features) data frame. *st_transform()* is added to transform the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) to EPSG: 3414, which is the CRS of [Singapore](https://epsg.io/3414).

::: callout-note
In *st_read():*

-   dsn: the directory where the shape file is stored

-   layer: the name of the shape file
:::

```{r}
busstop <- st_read(dsn = 'data/geospatial',
                   layer = 'BusStop') %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

From the message provided by R, it can be seen that the busstop sf data frame has 5161 rows, 3 columns, and has a CRS of SVY 21.

To get a better grasp of the busstop data frame, *glimpse()* function can be used.

::: callout-note
The data type for each column can be seen as well as some of their values. For sf data frames, there is a geometry column (POINT type) which contains the location information for each polygon.
:::

```{r}
glimpse(busstop)
```

### Importing Aspatial Data

The *read_csv()* function of readr can be used to import the origin_destination_bus_202309 CSV file into the R environment as a data frame.

```{r}
passenger <- read_csv('data/aspatial/origin_destination_bus_202309.csv')
```

From the message provided by R, it can be seen that the passenger has 5,714,196 rows and 7 columns.

*head()* can be used instead of *glimpse()* to view the top five rows of the passenger data frame. This will also allow us to see the data type of each of the column.

```{r}
head(passenger)
```

Note that the ORIGIN_PT_CODE and DESTINATION_PT_CODE are in the character ("chr") data type. However, we would like it to be in the factor ("fctr") data type for easier categorization and sorting. This can be done by using the *as.factor()* function.

```{r}
passenger$ORIGIN_PT_CODE <- as.factor(passenger$ORIGIN_PT_CODE)
passenger$DESTINATION_PT_CODE <- as.factor(passenger$DESTINATION_PT_CODE)
```

We can use *head()* to check the data type of the passenger data frame.

```{r}
head(passenger)
```

## Data Preparation

In order to perform our analysis, certain manipulations must be made in order to prepare the data. Specifically, the passenger data set will be filtered and summarzied. Subsequently, it will be combined with the busstop data set based on the bus stop code variable present in both data frames.

### Wrangling Aspatial Data

#### Filtering the passenger Data Set for Desired Time Frames

For the purpose of this study, the passenger data set needs to be filtered to only contain trips falling within one of the following time frames:

| Peak hour period             | Bus tap on time |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| Weekday morning peak         | 6am to 9am      |
| Weekday afternoon peak       | 5pm to 8pm      |
| Weekend/holiday morning peak | 11am to 2pm     |
| Weekend/holiday evening peak | 4pm to 7pm      |

This can be accomplished using the *filter()* function and the dplyr steps. We can create four separate data frames to store the four different time frames

```{r}
# Weekday morning peak 6am - 9am
passenger_wd_69 <- passenger %>%
  filter(DAY_TYPE == 'WEEKDAY') %>%
  filter(TIME_PER_HOUR >= 6 & TIME_PER_HOUR <= 9)

# Weekday afternoon peak 5pm - 8pm (17:00 - 20:00)
passenger_wd_1720 <- passenger %>%
  filter(DAY_TYPE == 'WEEKDAY') %>%
  filter(TIME_PER_HOUR >= 17 & TIME_PER_HOUR <= 20)

# Weekend/holiday morning peak 11am - 2pm (11:00 - 14:00)
passenger_weh_1114 <- passenger %>%
  filter(DAY_TYPE == 'WEEKENDS/HOLIDAY') %>%
  filter(TIME_PER_HOUR >= 11 & TIME_PER_HOUR <= 14)

# Weekend/holiday evening peak 4pm - 7pm (16:00 - 19:00)
passenger_weh_1619 <- passenger %>%
  filter(DAY_TYPE == 'WEEKENDS/HOLIDAY') %>%
  filter(TIME_PER_HOUR >= 16 & TIME_PER_HOUR <= 19)
```

After the different trips have been categorized into their separate data frames, the total number trips for each origin bus stop can be tallied into a single statistic for the study period. This can be accomplished using the *summarize()* function. The example below shows this operation using passenger_wd_69.

::: callout-note
The *group_by()* function is used to instruct R to conduct operations based on the groups created by *group_by().* In this case, the summary operations will be done based on the origin bus stop codes.
:::

```{r}
# Tallying the trips by origin bus stop for Weekday morning peak 6am - 9am
passenger_wd_69_tallied <- passenger_wd_69 %>%
  group_by(ORIGIN_PT_CODE) %>%
  summarise(TRIPS = sum(TOTAL_TRIPS))

passenger_wd_69_tallied
```

As can be seen, the newly created data frame consists only of the total trip numbers for each origin bus stop. This can be repeated for the other time frames.

```{r}
# Tallying the trips by origin bus stop for Weekday afternoon peak 5pm - 8pm (17:00 - 20:00)
passenger_wd_1720_tallied <- passenger_wd_1720 %>%
  group_by(ORIGIN_PT_CODE) %>%
  summarise(TRIPS = sum(TOTAL_TRIPS))

# Tallying the trips by origin bus stop for Weekend/holiday morning peak 11am - 2pm (11:00 - 14:00)
passenger_weh_1114_tallied <- passenger_weh_1114 %>%
  group_by(ORIGIN_PT_CODE) %>%
  summarise(TRIPS = sum(TOTAL_TRIPS))

# Tallying the trips by origin bus stop for Weekend/holiday evening peak 4pm - 7pm (16:00 - 19:00)
passenger_weh_1619_tallied <- passenger_weh_1619 %>%
  group_by(ORIGIN_PT_CODE) %>%
  summarise(TRIPS = sum(TOTAL_TRIPS))
```

### Wrangling Geospatial Data

In order to adequately visualize the busstop sf data frame, we need to define a mapping layer. An example of a mapping layer would be to use the Master Plan 2019 Planning Sub-zone created by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). However, for the purpose of this study, a hexagon layer will be used to ensure standardization of the size of each polygon and the evenly spaced gaps between a polygon and its neighbors.

The steps in this section will detail the creation of the hexagon layer using the busstop data frame and visualize the layer on a map of Singapore.

### Creating a Hexagon Layer in R

The steps taken in this section is based on the guide provided by Kenneth Wong of Urban Data Palette ([link](https://urbandatapalette.com/post/2021-08-tessellation-sf/)).

Firstly, a hexagon or honeycomb grid can be created based on the busstop data frame using the *st_make_grid()* function.

::: callout-note
There are some notable arguments in the *st_make_grid()* function:

-   cellsize = c(100,100): This argument indicates the size of each hexagon. If the cell size is large, each hexagon can encompasses multiple bus stops, whereas if a smaller cell size can help us differentiate between individual bus stop. However, a smaller cell size with many hexagons will take more time to create.

-   what = 'polygons': We would like to create polygons on a grid.

-   square = FALSE: The default argument is TRUE, which would create a square grid. FALSE is specified in order to create a hexagon grid.
:::

```{r}
area_honeycomb_grid = st_make_grid(busstop, cellsize = c(250,250), what = 'polygons', square = FALSE)

area_honeycomb_grid
```

The area_honeycomb_grid contains 136906 features of the same Projected CRS as the busstop data frame. If the *plot()* function is used, the hexagon grid will be displayed. However, this grid contains no information and might be too small to discern the individual cell.

```{r}
#qtm(area_honeycomb_grid)
```

The area_honey_comb needs to be converted to a sf data frame for further manipulation using *st_sf()*. Additionally, we can assign a unique id to each of the hexagon cell in area_honey_comb using *mutate().*

```{r}
honeycomb_grid_sf = st_sf(area_honeycomb_grid) %>%
  # add grid ID
  mutate(grid_id = 1:length(lengths(area_honeycomb_grid)))
```

Following this, we can use *lengths()* and *st_intersect()* to determine the allocation of bus stop in each cell. The goal is to create a new column, consisting of the number of bus stop in each of the cell. The *filter()* function can then be added to remove all cells with no bus stop and create the final sf data frame.

```{r}
# Counting the number of bus stop in each cell
honeycomb_grid_sf$n_busstop = lengths(st_intersects(honeycomb_grid_sf,busstop))

# Removing all cells without bus stop
honeycomb_count = filter(honeycomb_grid_sf, n_busstop > 0)

```

At this point, the hexagon grid of bus stop can be drawn onto a map of Singapore using the functions of the **tmap** package. Additionally, the n_busstop column can be passed to the *tm_fill()* function to shade the cell based on the number of bus stops in it.

::: callout-note
Several functions are added to make the map interactive and aesthetically pleasing

-   tmap_mode('view'): Creates an interactive map which allow zooming and interacting with cells on the map

-   pop.vars: Identifying the legend and value which pops up when a cell is selected. In this case, it is the number of bus stops.

-   popup.format: Specifying the format of the variable to be displayed when selecting a cell.

-   tm_basemap: Choosing the basemap layer on which the hexagon grid will be drawn. OpenStreetMap is chosen due to its high fidelity while not being overly crowded. Additionally, OpenStreetMap displays icon for bus stops in Singapore, allowing user to visually check any cell.

    -   If an incorrect CRS was specified in the earlier steps, the basemap will be of an incorrect location or alignment.
:::

```{r}
tmap_mode('view')

bushexmap <- tm_shape(honeycomb_count)+
  tm_fill(
    col = "n_busstop",
    palette = "Blues",
    style = "cont",
    title = "Number of bus stop",
    id = "grid_id",
    showNA = FALSE,
    alpha = 0.7,
    popup.vars = c(
      "Number of bus stop: " = "n_busstop"
    ),
    popup.format = list(
      n_busstop = list(format = "f", digits = 0)
    )
  ) +
  tm_borders(col = "grey40", lwd = 0.7)+
  tm_basemap(server = c('Esri.WorldGrayCanvas'))

bushexmap
```

::: callout-note
Search for the bus stop near your place and compare the numbers between the four maps by zooming in! Do you think it's accurate?
:::

By looking at the illustration, we can see that each cell might contain up to four bus stops. A bar chat can be drawn with the **ggplot2** package to visualize the distribution of number of bus stop in each cell.

```{r}
ggplot(honeycomb_count, aes(x=n_busstop))+
  geom_bar()+
  theme_classic()+
  geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = "count", vjust = -0.5, colour = "black")
```

As can be seen, the majority of cells contain 1-2 bus stop with only 250 cells containing more than 3 bus stops. This shows that the cells adequately capture solitary bus stop, as well as pairs of bus stops (bus stops which are opposite each other, served by the same bus services).

### Combining Aspatial and Geospatial Data

In order to conduct geospatial analysis, a data frame which contains the hexagon cells as well as the number of bus trips for each cells must be created. This can be done using the *left_join* argument.

::: callout-note
There are important arguments which can be used to create a cleaner combined data frame.

-   by = join_by(BUS_STOP_N == ORIGIN_PT_CODE)): Indicate the column by which the two data frames can be matched and joined. In this case, the bus stop code will be used.

-   select(1,4,5): Indicate the index number of the columns to be kept in the final data frame. Only the bus stop number (column 1), total number of trips (column 4), and geometry (column 5) will be kept.

-   replace(is.na(.),0): Replace all value of NA with 0. This is to ensure that bus stop with no trips in a given time frame is accurately tallied at 0.
:::

```{r}
# Weekday morning peak 6am - 9am
passenger_wd_69_combined <- left_join(busstop, passenger_wd_69_tallied, by = join_by(BUS_STOP_N == ORIGIN_PT_CODE))%>%
  select(1,4,5)%>%
  replace(is.na(.),0)

# Weekday afternoon peak 5pm - 8pm (17:00 - 20:00)
passenger_wd_1720_combined <- left_join(busstop, passenger_wd_1720_tallied, by = join_by(BUS_STOP_N == ORIGIN_PT_CODE))%>%
  select(1,4,5)%>%
  replace(is.na(.),0)

# Weekend/holiday morning peak 11am - 2pm (11:00 - 14:00)
passenger_weh_1114_combined <- left_join(busstop, passenger_weh_1114_tallied, by = join_by(BUS_STOP_N == ORIGIN_PT_CODE))%>%
  select(1,4,5)%>%
  replace(is.na(.),0)

# Weekend/holiday evening peak 4pm - 7pm (16:00 - 19:00)
passenger_weh_1619_combined <- left_join(busstop, passenger_weh_1619_tallied, by = join_by(BUS_STOP_N == ORIGIN_PT_CODE))%>%
  select(1,4,5)%>%
  replace(is.na(.),0)

```

It is important to note that the bus stops and their total trips have not been tallied into the hexagon cells. *st_join()* can be used to accomplish this for each time frame.

::: callout-note
The by argument in *st_join()* can be passed the function *st_within* to specify that we would like to join the two data frames where the geometry in the latter is within the geometry of the former. In this case, it would mean that two rows will be joined where the bus stop lies within a particular polygon.

-   The *group_by()* and *summarise()* functions here are used similarly to before, they sums up the total number of trips for all the bus stops in the hexagon, based on its grid_id, and create a new column called TOTAL_TRIP.
:::

```{r}
# Weekday morning peak 6am - 9am
hex_passenger_wd_69 <- st_join(honeycomb_count, passenger_wd_69_combined, by = st_within(sparse = FALSE), largest = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(grid_id)%>%
  summarise(TOTAL_TRIP = sum(TRIPS))

# Weekday afternoon peak 5pm - 8pm (17:00 - 20:00)
hex_passenger_wd_1720 <- st_join(honeycomb_count, passenger_wd_1720_combined, by = st_within(sparse = FALSE), largest = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(grid_id)%>%
  summarise(TOTAL_TRIP = sum(TRIPS))

# Weekend/holiday morning peak 11am - 2pm (11:00 - 14:00)
hex_passenger_weh_1114 <- st_join(honeycomb_count, passenger_weh_1114_combined, by = st_within(sparse = FALSE), largest = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(grid_id)%>%
  summarise(TOTAL_TRIP = sum(TRIPS))

# Weekend/holiday evening peak 4pm - 7pm (16:00 - 19:00)
hex_passenger_weh_1619 <- st_join(honeycomb_count, passenger_weh_1619_combined, by = st_within(sparse = FALSE), largest = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(grid_id)%>%
  summarise(TOTAL_TRIP = sum(TRIPS))

```

Let's try to map these hexagon grids to see if the visualization aligns with what we would expect.

```{r}
tmap_mode('view')
# Weekday morning peak 6am - 9am
weekday_morning <- tm_shape(hex_passenger_wd_69) +
  tm_fill(
    col = "TOTAL_TRIP",
    palette = "Blues",
    style = "quantile",
    title = "Number of Trips",
    id = "grid_id",
    showNA = FALSE,
    alpha = 0.7,
    popup.vars = c(
      "Number of Trips: " = "TOTAL_TRIP"
    ),
    popup.format = list(
      TOTAL_TRIP = list(format = "f", digits = 0)
    )
  ) +
  tm_borders(col = "grey40", lwd = 0.7)+
  tm_basemap(server = c('Esri.WorldGrayCanvas'))+
  tm_layout(title = 'Weekday Morning Peak', title.position = c('right', 'top'))


# Weekday afternoon peak 5pm - 8pm (17:00 - 20:00)
weekday_afternoon <- tm_shape(hex_passenger_wd_1720) +
  tm_fill(
    col = "TOTAL_TRIP",
    palette = "Blues",
    style = "quantile",
    title = "Number of Trips",
    id = "grid_id",
    showNA = FALSE,
    alpha = 0.7,
    popup.vars = c(
      "Number of Trips: " = "TOTAL_TRIP"
    ),
    popup.format = list(
      TOTAL_TRIP = list(format = "f", digits = 0)
    )
  ) +
  tm_borders(col = "grey40", lwd = 0.7)+
  tm_basemap(server = c('Esri.WorldGrayCanvas'))+
  tm_layout(title = 'Weekday Afternoon Peak', title.position = c('right', 'top'))

# Weekend/holiday morning peak 11am - 2pm (11:00 - 14:00)
weekend_noon <- tm_shape(hex_passenger_weh_1114) +
  tm_fill(
    col = "TOTAL_TRIP",
    palette = "Blues",
    style = "quantile",
    title = "Number of Trips",
    id = "grid_id",
    showNA = FALSE,
    alpha = 0.7,
    popup.vars = c(
      "Number of Trips: " = "TOTAL_TRIP"
    ),
    popup.format = list(
      TOTAL_TRIP = list(format = "f", digits = 0)
    )
  ) +
  tm_borders(col = "grey40", lwd = 0.7)+
  tm_basemap(server = c('Esri.WorldGrayCanvas'))+
  tm_layout(title = 'Weekend/holiday Morning Peak', title.position = c('right', 'top'))

# Weekend/holiday evening peak 4pm - 7pm (16:00 - 19:00)
weekend_evening <- tm_shape(hex_passenger_weh_1619) +
  tm_fill(
    col = "TOTAL_TRIP",
    palette = "Blues",
    style = "quantile",
    title = "Number of Trips",
    id = "grid_id",
    showNA = FALSE,
    alpha = 0.7,
    popup.vars = c(
      "Number of Trips: " = "TOTAL_TRIP"
    ),
    popup.format = list(
      TOTAL_TRIP = list(format = "f", digits = 0)
    )
  ) +
  tm_borders(col = "grey40", lwd = 0.7)+
  tm_basemap(server = c('Esri.WorldGrayCanvas'))+
  tm_layout(title = 'Weekend/holiday Evening Peak', title.position = c('right', 'top'))

tmap_arrange(weekday_morning, weekday_afternoon, weekend_noon, weekend_evening, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
```

::: callout-note
Search for the bus stop near your place and compare the numbers between the four maps by zooming in! Do you think it's accurate?
:::

From the rough visualization, it's clear that not all bus stops experience a similar level of traffic throughout different timing of the days. Additionally, based on the quantiles created by **tmap,** it seems that the ranges of passenger traffic are radically different between the four time windows. For example, certain grids during Weekday Morning Peak, a hexagon could reach 328,545 passenger trips, whereas the highest number during Weekend/holiday Morning Peak only reaches 112,330.

## Cleanup Step

Before we move on to the analysis of LISA, it would be wise to remove objects which will no longer be used. This will help to free up memory for other tasks. *rm()* can be used to perform this task

```{r}
rm(list = c('area_honeycomb_grid', 'bushexmap', 'honeycomb_count', 'honeycomb_grid_sf', 
     'passenger_wd_1720', 'passenger_wd_1720_tallied',    'passenger_wd_69', 'passenger_wd_69_tallied', 
    'passenger_weh_1114', 'passenger_weh_1114_tallied',
     'passenger_weh_1619', 'passenger_weh_1619_tallied'))
```

## Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA)

### Defining the Neighborhood

Before the LISA analysis can be conducted, it is important to define our neighborhood, or the neighbors of each polygon. This is based on the ideas that neighbors, or spatial objects which are related to other spatial objects based on sharing a common boundary or lying with a certain distance of one another, might affect each other.

In this case, we would like to identify the neighbors of each hexagon so that LISA analysis can determine if the number of trips in a hexagon in a time frame is correlated to the number of trips of the hexagons around it, either in the same direction or opposite direction.

The first step to determining the neighborhood is to choose a method by which neighbors are classified:

1.  Contiguity-based Method: Based on the sharing of boundaries, either edges and/or points (Queen and Rook method).
2.  Distance-based Method: Based on the distances between the centroid (central point of each hexagon) of each polygon. This can either be set to a distance where each hexagon has at least one neighbor (Fixed Distance) or where each polygon has a certain number of neighbors (Adaptive Distance).

It is important to choose the appropriate method according to each situation. However, in this study, Contiguity-based methods can be preemptively ruled out due to the fact that some cells have no co contiguous neighbors, as can be seen below.

![**Isolated Cells**](Isolated_Cells.png)

If the contiguity method is used, the LISA calculation for these cells would not be effective as they technically have no neighbors. This can be confirmed by using the *poly2nb()* function to create a Queen contiguity matrix for one time frame

```{r}
wm_q <- st_contiguity(st_geometry(hex_passenger_wd_1720))

summary(wm_q)
```

As can be seen from the weight matrix, 112 hexagon cells have 0 neighbor. **Therefore, a Distance-based Method would be suitable for analysis. Both Fixed Distance and Adaptive Distance methods will be utilized for more comprehensive comparison.**

### Creating a Distance-based Neighborhood Matrix

#### Creating a Fixed Distance Weight Matrix

*st_dist_band()* of **sfdep** is incredibly powerful in that it can create a neighbor list based on distance between the centroid of polygons and a lower and upper bound distance to other centroid. The default arguments for *st_dist_band()* will find neighbors with a lower and upper bound so that each hexagon will have at least one neighbor. This is the equivalent of the steps in **spdep** of the function *knearneigh()* of k=1.

*st_inverse_distance()* of a **sfdep** can be combined with *st_dist_band()* in a **dplyr** step to create a new column in each data frame of the different time frames to create a neighbor list and a inverse distance weight list.

```{r}
# Weekday morning peak 6am - 9am
wd69_nb <- hex_passenger_wd_69 %>%
  mutate(nb = st_dist_band(area_honeycomb_grid),
         wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, area_honeycomb_grid),
         .before = 1) # to put them in the front

# Weekday afternoon peak 5pm - 8pm (17:00 - 20:00)
wd1720_nb <- hex_passenger_wd_1720 %>%
  mutate(nb = st_dist_band(area_honeycomb_grid),
         wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, area_honeycomb_grid),
         .before = 1) # to put them in the front

# Weekend/holiday morning peak 11am - 2pm (11:00 - 14:00)
weh1114_nb <- hex_passenger_weh_1114 %>%
  mutate(nb = st_dist_band(area_honeycomb_grid),
         wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, area_honeycomb_grid),
         .before = 1) # to put them in the front

# Weekend/holiday evening peak 4pm - 7pm (16:00 - 19:00)
